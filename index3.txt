STRINGS AND LISTS

if you a assign a string to a string in python, yiu get a syntax error that cannot assign literal
Variable name is also known as identifier. eg sides-10- sides is identifier.
Binds- sides-10; sides is bound to 10, amy is bound to turtle.
literal- directly represent that data type.


COMPLEX STRINGS
Triple quotes """ used in the begging and end of very long STRINGS
ingle quotes to surround the whole string
The escape character \ to take care of the single quotes that are inside the string
The newline character \n to break the story to multiple lines
in summary, we can use the len function to find out how long a string is (i.e., how many characters the string has). We simply call the len function and pass it the string we want to check:

>>> len("Python")
6


We can also use the len function on lists:

>>> len([1, 2, 3])
3
